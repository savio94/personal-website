        <h4><u><b><i>Validation</i></b></u> : The most important aspect while building a product is to validate it that its something people want and that they would pay for. Often at times the assumptios that we make about what users want  would be completely different from what they want. So in those lines the real question is how quickly and effectively can we validate our hypothesis by ensuring the minimal usage of money and other resources.</h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><u><b><i>Talk to users : </i></b></u> : As YC always say talk to users. In the beginning stages, talking to users who are using our product or who we are targeting are the most effective thing to do.</h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><u><b><i>Mental Health</i></b></u> : Trying to do a startup is a lonely and an overwhelming journey. There will certainly be times when your mental health will start deteriorating. When it happens, accept its happening and seek methods to address it. Dont ignore it and push it out of the priority list hoping that it will amend itself. Also prioritize being in an environment which boosts productivity and has a positive impact on your mental health, because after all prevention is better than cure. Though there are a lot of discussions on the internet regarding the mental health issues of entrepreneurs but I have found Aaron Harris ( YC Designation)’s video to be quite helpful</h4>

        <h4><u><b><i>Team</i></b></u> : The Team is always the biggest asset that a startup can have.</h4>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h4><u><b><i>People</i></b></u> : The saying that we are the average of the five people that you spend your time with is in indeed true.The reason that we were able to make it so far was because of the fact that we were fortunate enough to be in the kerala startup mission ecosystem surrounded by others who were running startups.</h4>
